Basically - everything.

There are major visual changes, but I decide to use brand new project structure based on Webpack 2.

Changelog in brief:
* New project structure
* Add Webpack 2 config
* Add npm modules
* Add PUG template engine
* Change CSS preprocessor (moving from LESS to SASS)
* Minified files on production
* Add autoprefixer for SASS
* Change carousel library
* And much more..
